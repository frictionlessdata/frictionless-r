# frictionless 1.2.0

## Changes for users

* `add_resource()` now allows to replace an existing resource (#227).
* `read_resource()` now returns an error if both `path` and `data` are provided (#143).
* `write_package()` no longer writes to `"."` by default, since this is not allowed by CRAN policies. The user needs to explicitly define a directory (#205).
* `null` values in a read `datapackage.json` are now retained by `write_package()`, rather than being changed to empty lists. Properties assigned by the user to `NA` and `NULL` remain being written as `null` and removed respectively (#203).
* New vignettes `vignette("data-package")`, `vignette("data-resource")`, `vignette("table-dialect")` and `vignette("table-schema")` describe how frictionless implements the Data Package standard. The (verbose) function documentation of `read_resource()` and `create_schema()` has been moved to these vignettes, improving readability and maintenance (#208, #246).
* The included dataset `example_package` is removed in favour of the function `example_package()`. This function allows to reproducibly provide a local Data Package, without the need for an internet connection. The `observations` resource was also changed from a remote to a local resource and from CSV to TSV. **This change affects the use of `example_package` in older versions of frictionless.** We recommend to update frictionless to the latest version (#114, #253).

## Changes for developers

* `read_resource()` is now more modular under the hood, which should make it easier to extend (#210).
* [checklist](https://github.com/inbo/checklist) tooling was removed, in favour of `CITATION.cff` for citation and Zenodo deposit (#206).

* Add [Sanne Govaert](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8939-1305) as author. Welcome Sanne!

# frictionless 1.1.0

## Changes for users

* New function `print()` prints a human-readable summary of the Data Package, rather than a (long) list (#155).
* `read_package()` no longer returns a message regarding rights and credit (#121). If `package$id` is a URL (e.g. a DOI) it will be mentioned in `print()`.
* `add_resource()` accepts additional arguments via `...`. These are added as (custom) properties to the resource and are retained in `write_package()` (#195).
* `read_resource()` now supports column selection via the `col_select` argument from `readr::read_delim()`. This can vastly improve reading speed (#123). [Tidy selection](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/dplyr_tidy_select.html) is not supported.
* `write_package()` no longer adds `"profile": "tabular-data-package"` to `datapackage.json`. It is also removed from the example dataset (#188).
* Error and warning messages use semantic colours for variables, parameters, fields, etc.
* `readr::problems()` is included in NAMESPACE so you don't have to load readr to inspect parsing issues. The function is mentioned in the documentation of `read_resource()` (#129).

## Changes for developers

* A Data Package object (`package`) now has a `datapackage` class (#184). This enables a custom `print()` function (see above). `check_package()` will warn if the class is missing, **so previously saved Data Package objects (without the class) will generate a warning**.
* `check_package()` is now a public function, so it can be used in your package (#185). This and the other `check_` functions return the first argument silently (rather than `TRUE`), so they can be chained.
* `create_package()` now accepts a `descriptor` argument so that a Data Package object can be created from an existing object (#184). It will always validate the created object with `check_package()`.
* `cli::cli_abort()`, `cli::cli_warn()` and `cli::cli_inform()` are used for all errors, warnings, and messages (#163). This has several advantages:
  * Messages use semantic colours for variables, parameters, fields, etc.
  * Messages and warnings can be silenced with a global or local option, see [this blog post](https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/02/06/verbosity-control-packages/).
  * Each call has an [rlang](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rlang) class, e.g. `frictionless_error_fields_without_name`, making it easier to test for specific errors.
* [glue](https://cran.r-project.org/package=glue) and [assertthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=assertthat) are removed as dependencies (#163). The functionality of glue is replaced by cli, while `assertthat::assert()` calls are now `if ()` statements.
* [rlang](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rlang) is added as dependency (#192). It is already used by other dependencies.
* frictionless now depends on R >= 3.5.0.

## Other changes

* The package now adheres to the requirements of [checklist](https://github.com/inbo/checklist), so that `.zenodo.json` can be created with `checklist::update_citation()`.
* Add [Pieter Huybrechts](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6658-6062) as author and [Kyle Husmann](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9875-8976) as contributor. Welcome both!

# frictionless 1.0.3

* Add [stringi](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stringi) to `Suggests`. It was removed as a dependency from [rmarkdown](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmarkdown) 2.26, resulting in "stringi package required for encoding operations" build errors on CRAN (#176).

# frictionless 1.0.2

* Add `skip_if_offline()` to selected tests and verbosely include output in vignette examples, to avoid CRAN errors caused by timeouts (#116).

# frictionless 1.0.1

* Rebuild documentation for compatibility with HTML5 on request of CRAN.
* Add funder information.

# frictionless 1.0.0

* First release on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=frictionless). ðŸŽ‰
* Files (`datapackage.json`, resource files, schemas) can now be read from `(s)ftp://` URLs (#102).
* Package website is now served from <https://docs.ropensci.org/frictionless/>.

# frictionless 0.11.0

* `add_resource()` now sets `format`, `mediatype` and `encoding` for added CSV file(s) (#78).
* `add_resource()` now supports adding `schema` via path or URL.
* `write_package()` now supports added data to be gzip compressed before being written to disk (#98).
* `read_resource()` will now warn rather than error on unknown encoding (#86).
* `package` objects no longer have or require the custom attribute `resource_names`, use new function `resources()` instead (#97).
* `package` objects no longer have or require the custom attribute `datapackage`, making it easier to edit them as lists (with e.g. `append()`).

# frictionless 0.10.0

* `add_resource()` now supports adding CSV file(s) directly as a resource. This skips reading/handling by R and gives users control over `path` (#74).
* CSV files in a remotely read package (like `example_package`) are now downloaded when writing with `write_package()`, rather than being skipped. This is more consistent with locally read packages. The behaviour for resources with a `path` containing URLs (only) and resources with `data` remains the same (no files are written). The write behaviour is better explained in the documentation (#77).
* `write_package()` now silently returns the output rather than input `package`.
* `create_package()` will set `"profile" = "tabular-data-package"` since packages created by frictionless meet those requirements (#81).
* `create_schema()` interprets empty columns as `string` not `boolean` (#79).
* `read_package()` can now read from a `datapackage.yaml` file.
* `read_resource()` now accepts YAML Table Schemas and CSV dialects.
* `add_resource()`/`create_schema()`'s `df` argument is renamed to `data`.
* `example_package`'s `observations` resource now has URLs as `path` to serve as an example for that.

# frictionless 0.9.0

* Add vignette with overview of functionality (#60).
* Prepare frictionless for rOpenSci submission.
