#' Write a Data Package to disk
#'
#' Writes a Data Package and its related Data Resources to disk as a
#' `datapackage.json` and CSV files.
#' Already existing CSV files of the same name will not be overwritten.
#' The function can also be used to download a Data Package in its entirety.
#' The Data Resources are handled as follows:
#' - Resource `path` has at least one local path (e.g. `deployments.csv`):
#'   CSV files are copied or downloaded to `directory` and `path` points to new
#'   location of file(s).
#' - Resource `path` has only URL(s): resource stays as is.
#' - Resource has inline `data` originally: resource stays as is.
#' - Resource has inline `data` as result of adding data with `add_resource()`:
#'   data are written to a CSV file using [readr::write_csv()], `path` points to
#'   location of file, `data` property is removed.
#' @param package List describing a Data Package, created with [read_package()]
#'   or [create_package()].
#' @param directory Path to local directory to write files to.
#' @return `package` as written to file (invisibly).
